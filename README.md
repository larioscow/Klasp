<p>This project is an older website that I developed while learning JavaScript. It played a crucial role in expanding my knowledge of vanilla web development. Despite the fact that I am no longer actively working on it, I appreciate the design and concepts of the website. I am excited to revisit it and use my current skills and modern practices to give it a fresh update. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
